# competitive_programming
This repository contains solutions to the programming problems from various websites.
I am currently solving programming problems using C and Python, which are part of my Computer Science course.
Competitive programming requires you to come up with solutions, that work well within the given time constraints.
Therefore knowing limited programming languages never helps, we must therefore look for the best suited programming language.
Python is not a good language for competitive programming,since it's very slow.
I am still a beginner, therefore excuse me if you don't find the solution efficient or not solved in the most suited language.
